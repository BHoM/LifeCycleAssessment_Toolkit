The influence of system expansion to the GWP for steel products is 3 to 7% lower GWP.  Contact Worldsteel for more information. At an EOL recovery rate of 85%.

Steel coil rolled on a hot-strip mill. It can be found on the market in coil or in sheets and is further processed into finished products by the manufacturers. The various types of hot rolled steel have applications in virtually all sectors of industry: transport, construction, shipbuilding, gas containers, pressure vessels, energy pipelines, etc.  Hot rolled steel sheet with an anti-slip surface and a diamond or teardrop pattern are typically used for stairs, industrial floors and tailboards for goods vehicles. Typical thickness between 2 - 7 mm. Typical width between 600 - 2100 mm. System expansion was used on the steel, e.g. for blast furnace slag and other co-products.
