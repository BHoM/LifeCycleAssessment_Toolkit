System expansion was used on the steel, e.g. for blast furnace slag and other co-products. The influence of system expansion to the GWP for steel products is 3 to 7% lower GWP.  Contact Worldsteel for more information. At an EOL recovery rate of 85%. Module D impact of -0.34 kg CO2e per kg ('-' magnitude is a benefit, '+' magnitude a burden).
