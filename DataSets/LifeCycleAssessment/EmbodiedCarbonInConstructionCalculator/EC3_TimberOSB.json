The layers of strands and resin are then pressed into large sheets which are cut down to standard sizes. OSB is a versatile product that is used in a variety of applications. OSB is most commonly associated with the construction and renovation of single family homes. It is no surprise that commercial and residential construction consumes the greatest share of OSB relative to other uses.
