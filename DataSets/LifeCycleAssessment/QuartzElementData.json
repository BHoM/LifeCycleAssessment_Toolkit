The plastic, which is expandable polystyrene, is manufactured by suspension polymerization of polystyrene. Small EPS beads are formed. After that a blowing agent is added. This can be a low- boiling hydrocarbon like pentane or butane. The foaming process takes place in three steps: prefoaming, intermediate storage, final foaming. During the first step, the plastic beads are heated and softened. The blowing agent evaporates and bubbles filling the plastic and increasing the bead diameter are formed. In the second step, another molding process takes place, in which air is used as an additional blowing agent and allows the material to withstand the external atmospheric pressure when the finished part is removed from the mold. In the third step, perforated molds are filled with the prefoamed beads and exposed to steam. The beads expand and fill the pores. The temperature range during prefoaming and final foaming is from 85 to 120°C. To achieve flame- proof foams, the surface can be coated with organobromine compounds like hexabromocyclododecane.
